ipv6_patches
============

Patches to update some security tools I use to work with IPv6.
Some of the patches may be rather hackish, but then again a lot of these tools can be as well. :/
If you'd like to contribute patches to improve these patches, or want to point out I've broken something, by all means, holler.

All patches should be considered licensed the same as the code they're modifying unless otherwise specified.

A copy of the software being patched is included for convenience; you're free to simply grab the patch and acquire your own original copy.
