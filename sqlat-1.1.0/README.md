SQLAT 1.1.0
===========

SQL Auditing Tools by cqure.net, and an older FreeTDS library these tools rely upon.

Thus far, I've tested the following, and all seem to work against a IPv4 and a IPv6 SQL Server 2012 box:

-sqlanlz
-sqldict
-sqldirtree
-sqldumplogins
-sqlquery

More testing and, if needed, fixes to follow.
